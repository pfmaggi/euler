# Project Euler Solutions in multiple languages

These are solutions to the various
[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems in multiple languages,
updated as I feel like it. These are not necessarily the fastest
solutions but rather simple, clean solutions that run in under a
minute on modest hardware. The purpose is to play with different
languages using different paradigms.

## Format

Each solution is provided in it's own file, `p_000x.*`, providing
a single function named `euler-000x`, which takes no arguments and
returns an integer representing the answer.

Functions useful to multiple problems can be found in
`common.*`.
